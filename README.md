# MorePythonPractice
This repository contains a collection of current practice python programs.

The kata folder contains challenges presented by my university programming group.
The pythonGraphicsPrograms is pretty self-explanatory. This is where I am testing out draw() and other simple graphical interfaces.

Many of the other programs are scripts to find quick solutions to various problems (quadratic equation solver, getting system info, etc) in the terminal.
